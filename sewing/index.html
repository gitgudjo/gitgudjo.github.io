This is a visual tutorial on how to make a pair of shorts. These skills can be used for other sewing projects as all of the skills are transferable.

The first step is to use a template to base your piece off of. You can use another pair of shorts or buy a template in store. Using a template thats bigger is better than using one that's too small.

Fold the material in half to cut both sides of the clothing at the same time.

Use pins to keep the template steady.

Use the sewing machine to outline the pieces you cut and prevent the edge of the material from falling apart. This will not be visible in the final product.

Sew the frontside of the shorts together with the fronside of the pockets. Be sure to use the appropriate thread as it will be visible.

Using the overlock or sewing machine, sew together the four main pieces of the shorts. Using clips can help hold the fabric in place before you sew it.

Remember to sew things together inside out in order to hide any thread. Be sure to sew over points where several pieces meet several times to avoid any ripping.

Fold the top and bottom inwards and sew it shut for a cleaner look and a place to add a string.

Add eyelets and washers to the holes to prevent any ripping. Use a safety pin to bring the draw-string through the pants.
